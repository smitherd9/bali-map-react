              In 1976, the ethnomusicologist Andrew Toth measured the
              tunings of each bronze key and gong-kettle of 49 complete sets of
              gong keybar.

              were later played back at correct speed by using a Kudelski Slo
              Resolver. In both instances, the measurements were made with the
              Hale-Sight-o-Tuner, a Stroboconn-type device which is solid state,
              portable and accurate to +/- 0.5 cent. All pitch measurements were
              made in terms of deviation from Western equal temperament, with
              the octave defined as 1200 cents and the half step as 100 cents."

              His meticulously gathered data has been stored in the special collections at Wesleyan
              University Library which includes seven boxes of "his letters, photographs, 
              concert notices, course notes, and computer printouts of tuning frequencies<sup><a href="#citation1">1</a></sup>."

              That data was then put into&nbsp;

                Soniccouture's Balinese Gamelan II VST</a>, which was created by 
                sampling the gamelan semaradana belonging to the London Symphony Orchestra.</p>   

                <p className="text-p-nagra">You may notice that not all instruments are present
                in all the audio clips.  This is because (as far as I know) data for those instruments 
                was not available, either because Andrew Toth did not record the data or that particular
                ensemble did not have those instruments in the late 70s.  Similarly, you may hear more instruments
                as some gamelan had penyacah, some didn't, and some had two pairs of pemade/kantil while others 
                only had one.</p>

                <p className="text-p-nagra">It is hoped that this will allow the listener a glimpse 
                into the wildly diverse and beautiful world of Balinese tuning preferences 
                (<em>from your own home!</em>) by hearing samples of pieces played on different gamelan.</p>
